# About

The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories,
and data generators that are used by the machine learning community
for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms.

The archive was created as an FTP archive in 1987 by UCI PhD student David Aha.
Since that time, it has been widely used by students, educators,
and researchers all over the world as a primary source of machine learning datasets.

Many people deserve thanks for making the repository a success.
Foremost among them are the donors and creators of the databases and data generators.
Special thanks should also go to the past librarians of the repository:
David Aha, Patrick Murphy, Christopher Merz, Eamonn Keogh, Cathy Blake,
Seth Hettich, David Newman, Arthur Asuncion, Moshe Lichman, Dheeru Dua, Casey Graff,
Kolby Nottingham, Rachel Longjohn, and Markelle Kelly.

Funding support from the National Science Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.
